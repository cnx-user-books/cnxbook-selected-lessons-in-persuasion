          <note type="Language Support" id="idp896336"><label>Language Support</label>English learners benefit from having a handout in addition to seeing the information on the overhead. It is helpful for students to hear the different voices of multiple readers and the repetition of the reading assists comprehension, especially English learners' oral comprehension. The Amplified Handouts provided in the unit were developed for English learners with an intermediate level of English proficiency; however, they can be amplified for all students along the continuum by extending language or content study as needed. </note>
Explain to students that Frederick Douglass was a former slave who became one of the principal people speaking out about the abolition of slavery in the 19th century. </para>

For instance, you might show them your own notebook and point out how you title some writings and not others. Show them a range of writings (e.g., some notes you took while thinking through a new idea, a response you wrote to an article you read, a list of quotations you have been collecting, a description of something you saw).</para><note type="Pedagogical Support" id="idp4932816"><label>Pedagogical Support</label>
Writing is both a tool for thinking and a rehearsal for speaking. Give students two to three minutes to write individually before sharing what they wrote with a partner or in a trio. 
         <quote display="block" id="idm8851392"/>
          It is important for students to take time to restate the quotation before agreeing or disagreeing with what is said. Explicit self-explanation supports comprehension.
          Quick Writes are opportunities to assess students' initial understanding and think about how to support their learning as the lesson proceeds.

        <note type="Amplified Reader's/Writer's Notebook" id="idm2093536"><label>Amplified Reader's/Writer's Notebook</label>The teacher resource, <link url="http://ifl.lrdc.pitt.edu/cnx/ela/2_RWNB%20Resource_ELL%20Amplificationv3.pdf">Amplified Readers‚Äô Writer‚Äôs Notebook</link>, includes extended activities for English Learners to help them identify key cognates and vocabulary that will aid their reading comprehension. The resource also illustrates how to help learners build upon previous language study from earlier grades. The example from Lesson 1 follows up on the students‚Äô close examination of language during an earlier study of Martin Luther King‚Äôs speech, ‚ÄúI Have a Dream.‚Äù At that time, students underlined repetitive phrases, starred the main verb in each sentence, and marked phrases that were similar. This aided English learners‚Äô comprehension through a systematic study of language structure and syntax in meaning making and aligned with the California LC1.2 Standard: Understand sentence construction (e.g., parallel structure, subordination, proper placement of modifiers) and proper English usage (e.g., consistency of verb tenses). The teacher resource shows how to have students use the <link url="http://ifl.lrdc.pitt.edu/cnx/ela/AMP_HANDOUT_Inspiring%20Change.pdf">Amplified Douglass Handout</link> in Lesson 1. On the Amplified Handout, the repeated words are in italics and students are asked to note Douglass use of syntax in order to aid in their literal, beginning comprehension of the text.  Teachers are encouraged to remind students of the habits of thinking about reading text they already know how to use from earlier work and to apply that learning here. The Reader‚Äôs/Writer‚Äôs Notebook gives them a place to record what they think Douglass‚Äô quotation is about. </note>

        <title>Share in Pairs or Trios</title>
        <note type="Classroom Environment" id="idp2154976"><label>Classroom Environment</label>Sharing in pairs or trios allows students to "try out" their thinking, receive feedback from a peer, and consider another person's perspective before sharing their responses with the whole class.  This is an important support for all students, especially English learners. 
Listening in on students' conversations allows you to consider which students you might invite to share first, second, etc., to launch the group discussion. As you prepare to facilitate the whole group discussion, invite at least one English learner to share his or her response. Teachers can talk to the student about this during the pair/trio share, so that he or she can be prepared to share with the whole class. Doing this can build a learner's confidence, help to create a more inclusive classroom environment, and encourage other English learners to share.


        </note>
        <note type="Language Support" id="idm1335568"><label>Language Support</label>Teachers can use the "revoicing" technique to restate students' words to help them develop academic content and language skills. "Revoicing," proposing your academic-English translation of a student's words in the form of a question and giving the student an opportunity to accept, revise, or elaborate on what you say, is an Accountable Talk technique that turns ownership of the contribution back to the student. Using it gives both you and the speaker a chance to consider whether your interpretation of the student's words is valid. This quick double-check adds emphasis to the point by marking its importance and also gives students an extra moment to take in the new terminology and connect it to the example. It is a useful technique for all students, and the repetition and modeling of academic language is especially useful for English learners.</note>

        <title>Discuss in Whole Group </title>
 <para id="id4631701">
Begin by asking a few students to restate the quotation in their own words.  Then ask students if they agree or disagree with the speaker's view.  Encourage students to talk to each other and to agree, disagree, question, or in some way respond to one another. Listen carefully to the substance of what students are saying so you can ask them at appropriate points to clarify or elaborate or explain how their responses relate to what was said previously.  As part of the discussion, ask students to consider what effect the identity of the speaker had on whether they agreed or disagreed with the quotation.  You might ask students if they would have felt the same way if a slaveholder, rather than former slave, spoke those lines.

Then Sojourner Truth, who had not been invited to the convention, stood up to speak without notes or a written text.

The issues the class comes up with will be what they choose from as topics for their speeches. One of the speeches they will plan and deliver in 20 minutes with a partner; the other speech they will have two days to plan on their own. With that in mind, students should look for two different types of topics: (1) those that can be argued using the students' own experience as evidence, and (2) those that require print/media research. Suggest that students make notes in their Reader's/ Writer's Notebooks about the issues they are considering.</para>
        <para id="id4632105">Ask students to give examples of issues they might know enough about that they could persuade others without library research, and those that will require research. Students should consider their audience (their peers), understanding that whether or not research is needed will depend on the audience's knowledge of the issue as well as the students' own.</para>
        <para id="id4632121">The class will discuss their ideas in a later lesson in the unit. Every student should have at least two issues to share that day.</para>
